# CS50-Solutions

Solutions for all the Problem sets of EDX course - HarvardX CS50 : Introduction to Computer science.

These are the very basic solutions to all the 8 problem sets.

When I did this course there was no cloud based IDE so I installed the Harvard CS50 machine and completed the course on that.

There might be some Problem sets that have been changed, so I'll update them later.

These solutions are for reference purposes only, please try to solve the problem sets on your own.

As for the Final Project , I made a very basic HTML website which barely qualifies as a project. Here's the link:-

KTHXBAI!! 



*Disclaimer*
I do not own any piece of code and this is only for refrence purposes.(yeah,right).
Also i did complete this course in 2015 and recieved my honor code certificate.
